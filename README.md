# Titanic Data Analysis Project üõ≥Ô∏è

As part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I worked on this data analysis project exploring the famous Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns and visualize survival factors.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset  
- Visualizing survival rates based on gender, passenger class, fare, age, and embarkation port  
- Highlighting key correlations to understand the factors influencing survival

## üìä Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- `pandas` and `numpy` ‚Äì data preprocessing and manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` ‚Äì data visualization

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps & Visualizations
‚úÖ **Data Cleaning:**
- Filled missing `Age` values with the median age  
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with the most frequent value (mode)  
- Dropped the `Cabin` column due to a high number of missing values  
- Removed duplicate rows  

‚úÖ **Visual Analysis:**
1. **Survival Count:** Number of passengers who survived vs. did not survive
2. **Survival by Gender:** Comparison of survival rates between males and females
3. **Age Distribution:** Age spread of all passengers
4. **Age vs. Survival:** Distribution of age among survivors vs. non-survivors
5. **Passenger Class vs. Survival:** Impact of passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) on survival
6. **Fare Distribution by Survival:** Boxplot showing fare differences
7. **Embarked vs. Survival:** Effect of embarkation port on survival
8. **Correlation Heatmap:** Visual relationship between `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Age`, and `Fare`
9. **Pairplot:** Interactions among key numerical features

## ‚ú® Insights
- Female passengers had higher survival rates than male passengers.
- Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive.
- Higher ticket fares often correlated with higher survival rates.
- Majority of passengers were young adults; elderly passengers were fewer.


## üöÄ Result
This project demonstrates how data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visual storytelling can help derive meaningful insights from historical data.
